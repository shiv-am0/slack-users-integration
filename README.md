# Slack Users Integration

## Use Case

This project integrates Auth0 authentication with Slack using a React frontend and an Express backend. It allows users to log in with Google, and upon successful authentication, the user details are stored in a MongoDB database. Users can get the channel details of the defined workspace and users can send their details to a Slack channel.
